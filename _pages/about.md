<!-- At the University of Innsbruck, our Cryptography Team focuses on the design and cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives and their applications in real-world contexts, such as industrial environments, IoT-constrained devices, and privacy-preserving machine learning. Our current research explores how algebraic geometry can be applied to both the design and analysis of symmetric-key primitives, particularly within privacy-preserving protocols like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs), Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). We are especially interested in understanding and developing the fundamental design principles behind cryptographic functions, drawing on insights from computational algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory to advance secure and efficient cryptographic systems. -->

### Research Team
The cryptography research team at the Department of Computer Science consists of:
- [Ass.-Prof. Dr. Arnab Roy](https://byt3bit.github.io/)
- [Luca Campa, MSc.](https://lucacampa.it/) 

##### Visitors:
- Massimo Fumiani, *University of Trento, Department of Mathematics* (Master's student). 

### Courses

Information about the cryptography courses we offer can be found in [Courses](\teaching). 

### Research Seminars

We organise research seminars on the topic of Cryptography and Theoretical and Mathematical Foundations. Please check the [Seminars](/seminars) webpage.

### Master's thesis
We welcome interested students from both local and international universities to join our research activities and develop their Master’s theses within our team. Through close collaboration, students gain hands-on experience in cutting-edge cryptographic research, working alongside our researchers on topics that bridge theoretical foundations and practical applications in modern cryptography. For details on Master's thesis topics, email us.

**<span style="color: darkorange">Note</span>**: we do not have any paid internship position at the moment.  

For available Master's thesis check the [Thesis](/thesis) webpage.
