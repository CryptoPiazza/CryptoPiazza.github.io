At the University of Innsbruck, our Cryptography Team focuses on the design and cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives and their applications in real-world contexts, such as industrial environments, IoT-constrained devices, and privacy-preserving machine learning. Our current research explores how algebraic geometry can be applied to both the design and analysis of symmetric-key primitives, particularly within privacy-preserving protocols like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs), Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). We are especially interested in understanding and developing the fundamental design principles behind cryptographic functions, drawing on insights from computational algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory to advance secure and efficient cryptographic systems.

### Team members
- [Ass.-Prof. Dr. Arnab Roy](https://byt3bit.github.io/)
- [Luca Campa, MSc.](https://lucacampa.it/)

### Previous internships
Every year, we welcome students from both local and international universities to join our research activities and develop their Master’s theses within our team. Through close collaboration, students gain hands-on experience in cutting-edge cryptographic research, working alongside our researchers on topics that bridge theoretical foundations and practical applications in modern cryptography.
