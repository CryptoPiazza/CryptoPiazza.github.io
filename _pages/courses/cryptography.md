lecturers: ["Ass.-Prof. Dr. Arnab Roy"]
term: Winter
hours: 2
ects: "4,5"
format: "In-person lectures"
prerequisites: "Cryptography"
objective: "In-depth understanding of cryptography; Students master the concepts and theoretical basics for the construction of current cryptographic procedures. They know elementary security terms and typical attacks on cryptography. They can analyse the secure use of selected cryptographic procedures in practical systems and, if necessary, familiarise themselves with similar procedures independently."
topics: [
    "Primers on supporting theory: information theory, coding theory, number theory, computational complexity",
    "Cryptographic primitives: ideal functionality, security definition, selected designs (DES, AES, DH, RSA, ECDH/ECDSA, SHA3), security analysis","Cryptanalysis: basic approaches and examples",
    "Vulnerability of cryptographic primitives under quantum computation model",
    "Secure cryptographic primitive under quantum computation model",
    "Selected topics: commitment schemes, zero-knowledge, secret sharing, multi-party computation."
