lecturers: ["Ass.-Prof. Dr. Arnab Roy"]
term: Winter
hours: 3
ects: 5
format: "In-person lectures"
prerequisites: "Cryptography"
objective: "Specialization in a research field of cryptography; Students understand how advanced cryptographic protocols enable computation without having access to the data in plaintext. They learn about the security notions and models of such protocols. They can compare different approaches in terms of their security and efficiency, know about design principles and constraints for cryptographic primitives to be used in the context of secure computation, and are enabled to select suitable protocols for a given application (e.g., transaction privacy). They can study selected research papers and, if necessary, are capable of familiarising themselves with similar research works independently."
topics: [
    "Models and security notions of secure computation",
    "Secret sharing",
    "Oblivious Transfer",
    "Selected protocols in the semi-honest setting",
    "Commitment schemes and zero-knowledge in the malicious setting",
    "Secure symmetric cryptography for multi-party computation and zero-knowledge proof systems (e.g. low multiplicative complexity requirement, arithmetic-oriented construction of block ciphers and hash functions)."
